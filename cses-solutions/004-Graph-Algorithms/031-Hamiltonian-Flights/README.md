The problem described here is equivalent to count the number of [Hamiltonian path problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamiltonian_path_problem)
A Hamiltonian path, a path that visits every vertex in the graph exactly once.

To solve this problem, we will use  Bellman, Held, and Karp algorithm, wich is a dp algorithm
